If you don’t quite have the dollars for a top-tier stay at Bellagio or Caesars Palace, and splurging on a suite isn’t in your budget, there’s still a place for you in a compact, forest green room at Park MGM. After a $550 million renovation transformed the former Monte Carlo into this budget-friendly but still chic option back in 2018, it quickly became one of the best all-around stays on The Strip. Aside from affordable rates, the property’s amenities include a smoke-free casino with low minimum buy-ins, a sizable pool complex brimming with party vibes and an incredible selection of both sit-down restaurants and more casual grab-and-go dining options. Foodies shouldn’t miss the bodega-fronted Best Friend from Roy Choi, a delightful mashup of Korean-American fusion (think Kimchi Carbonara), raucous hip-hop and boozy, frozen drinks.", "hour": 1, "addr": 2, "rooms_left": 3}}, {"model": "sea.hotel", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "The Grand Plaza", "description": "New York is a city in the US", "hour": 2, "addr": 2, "rooms_left": 22}}]
